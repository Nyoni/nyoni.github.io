                                One of the core functions of Community Conservation Programs 
                                section is to provide conservation education and extension 
                                services to the general populace for their support in wildlife 
                                conservation. <br>
                                Conservation Education Programme aims to instil an appreciation for wildlife, 
                                conservation, sustainability, environmental processes, cultural heritage, 
                                as well as to equip students with a range of life skills. <br> As we are now focusing
                                on conservation with people, this contributes to the overall mandate of ZimParks 
                                in terms of enhancing wildlife conservation, protection, and management, improving 
                                ZimParks brand, establishing linkages, recognition and improvement of relations with 
                                stakeholders. Conservation Education is instrumental in soliciting for support from 
                                both local and international communities. <br><br>
                                World over, challenges facing conservation are on the increase. <br>
                                Economic hardships parroted by changing lifestyles have led our populaces to be 
                                disconnected from matters of conservation of wildlife and its habitats. <br> 
                                To bridge the gap ZimParks has taken the burden upon its shoulders to educate our 
                                populace in matters related to wildlife conservation and its habitat. <br>
                                We say to you students, teachers and community members, a visit to the parks is a

                                Conservation education provides authentic opportunities for 
                                learning and gives school going children from Primary to tertiary 
                                level an opportunity to connect with flora and fauna in a meaningful 
                                way. <br> Zimparks provide students with a real-life context on which 
                                to base their learning, and an opportunity to apply their learning to 
                                authentic local community opportunities. <br> Conservation education in schools 
                                is about our natural environment and the plants, animals and birds that live 
                                in our very own backyards, school playgrounds and protected areas. <br> Conservation 
                                education results in a range of outcomes. <br> Through students applying acquired 
                                knowledge, skills and values, they can actively take a leadership role for a 
                                range of real life local conservation issues. <br><br>
                                ZimParks do have programs which suits all age groups in our conservation outreach 
                                programs. <br> Changes experienced in the growth of children correlates to their 
                                ability to understand and explore the world. <br> For the effective delivery of 
                                conservation education in schools, Zimparks staff uses teaching and learning 
                                methods most appropriate for the age and developmental stage of a student.  <br><br>
                                The focus of conservation education in early childhood should encourage children
                                 to explore and experience their local environment through nature- based play. <br> 
                                 Teachings graduate with age into participating in local conservation 
                                 opportunities in home and school life where students can apply their learning 
                                 and take action for the environment. For adolescence, teachings comes with the 
                                 application of knowledge, skills and values through participating and collaborating 
                                 in conservation. <br><br>

                                In today’s conservation practises, indigenous communities 
                                play a pivotal role in effective landscape scale conservation 
                                of wildlife resources. <br> Community involvement in all activities 
                                including planning and natural management to ensure the long-term 
                                success of any project critical in the conservation field. <br> 
                                One way to achieve this is through Community conservation 
                                education which aims to enhance a community’s wellness through 
                                thoughtful environmental action. <br> It fosters collaborative 
                                learning and action, taking into account the social, cultural, economic, 
                                and environmental conditions of a community. <br> Building connections 
                                among people is important in achieving conservation objectives. <br> 
                                Local communities play a vital role in the fight against wildlife crime. <br> 
                                However, engaging communities to support wildlife conservation activities 
                                is often challenging and in most cases, takes a long time. <br> ZimParks 
                                found it important to build community institutions that represent the voice 
                                of the people. <br> It is important that communities acquire critical skills 
                                such as planning, budgeting, financial management, and monitoring to help them 
                                engage and lead wildlife related livelihoods project activities and supporting 
                                wildlife resources protection. <br> To achieve this ZWPMA has posted full
